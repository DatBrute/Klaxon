Units have a radar range and vision range.
They have a flat modifier for enemy radar range, and a % modifer for visual range.
At max range they will detect enemies on average in 10 seconds (random chance each pframe).
At half range they will detect enemies instantly. This scales linearly in terms of time.
Once detecteed, an enemy will undetect only once it leaves range. It will then do so instantly.

Chaff will appear at radar/visual range or within its own AoE without modifiers. It will be ineffective once radar-detected.
All aspects of radar power decrease if you are turning too much.
Can direct radar, taking a few seconds to boost in 90 degree arc, at cost to own.
